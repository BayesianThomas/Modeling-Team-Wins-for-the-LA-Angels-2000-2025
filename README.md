# Modeling Team Wins for the LA Angels (2000-2025)

Multiple regression analysis predicting team wins from batting statistics, with systematic model comparison and selection.

**Methods:** 
- Correlation analysis to identify key predictors
- Systematic comparison of 2-variable, 3-variable, interaction, and quadratic models
- Model selection using Adjusted R², RMSE, and Coefficient of Variation

**Tools:** SAS (PROC REG, PROC CORR, PROC SGPLOT, PROC MEANS)

**Results:** Two-variable model (hits + batting average) provided best fit with Adj R² = 0.55 and RMSE = 6.84 games. Adding complexity did not improve predictive performance.
